		<p>You can create new shapes by converting geometric shapes (created using the Shape tools) into curves and then adjusting the nodes of the resulting shape.</p>

		<p>The <span class="term">Convert to Curves</span> operation is not limited to geometric shapes. You can convert almost any object to curves, including text.</p>

		<aside class="box warning">
			<p>Once an object has been converted to curves, it can no longer be edited in its conventional way. For example, you would not be able to change the font of text once it has been converted to curves.</p>

		<aside class="box tip">
			<p>New shapes can also be created by joining two or more objects together in a variety of ways. For more information, see the <a href="join.html">Joining objects</a> topic.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Select the shape with either the <span class="ui">Move</span> or the <span class="ui">Node Tool</span>.</li>
				<li>Do one of the following:<ul>
						<li>Click <span class="ui">Convert to Curves</span> on the context toolbar.</li>
						<li>From the <span class="ui">Layer</span> menu, select <span class="ui">Convert to Curves</span>.</li>

			<p>The shape is now made from curves and the <span class="ui">Node Tool</span> is automatically selected. Segments and nodes can be modified with the Node Tool.</p>
