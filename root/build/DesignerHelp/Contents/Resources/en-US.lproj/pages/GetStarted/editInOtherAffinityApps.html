		<h1>Editing files in other Affinity apps</h1>

		<p>Affinity apps allow you to edit placed and linked Designer, Photo and Publisher project files in their native apps. This approach helps keep the responsibilities for layout, graphic design and photography separate from each other. Using this approach, respective personnel in a team can develop their own content independently of other disciplines. Linked content will automatically be updated.</p>
