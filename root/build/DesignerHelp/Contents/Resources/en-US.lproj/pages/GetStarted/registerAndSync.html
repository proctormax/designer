		<h1>App registration and content syncing</h1>
		<p>Registering your Affinity app requires an Affinity ID, an account that's used to manage your purchases from the <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/store" target="_blank">Affinity Store</a>. You can create a new Affinity ID when registering your app, or sign in to an existing one.</p>
		<p>Registration is not compulsory to use the app. However, as a bonus for doing so, a license for specially selected content is added to your account free of charge. You do not have to register payment information to create an Affinity ID and claim the free content.</p>
		<p>Content purchased from the store, such as brush packs and .afassets files, is easily installed&#8212;manually or automatically&#8212;and available to use at all times. A persistent Internet connection is not required.</p>

	<aside class="box note">
		<p>For Mac, this feature requires macOS Sierra 10.12 or above.</p>

		<h2>Registering your app</h2>
		<p>The registration window is presented the first time your Affinity app is opened. If you deferred registration at that time, select <span class="ui">My Account</span> on the <span class="ui">Toolbar</span> to reopen the window.</p>

		<h2>Managing your Affinity ID</h2>
		<p>With your app signed in to your account, the window changes to show all the content registered to your Affinity ID.</p>

		<p>From here, you can manage your Affinity ID, choose which content is installed, and customize the app's installation behavior. The default behavior is never to automatically download content, which avoids unwanted consumption of any metered data allowance.</p>
		<p>To open this window at a later time, select <span class="ui">My Account</span> on the <span class="ui">Toolbar</span>.</p>
