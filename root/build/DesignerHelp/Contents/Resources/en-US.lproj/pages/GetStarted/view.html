		<h1>Viewing</h1>

		<p>There are a variety of viewing options available which lets you preview your designs before output using view modes, make mode comparisons and arrange your document view.</p>

	<section class="about">
		<h2>View modes</h2>
		
		<figure>
			<div class="single"><img src="../../../shared/view_modes.png" alt="View Modes" /></div>
			<figcaption>(A) Pixel, (B) Retina Pixel and (C) Outline View Modes.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<h4>Vector</h4>
		<p>Drawn objects are displayed as vectors by default. This means that, regardless of the current zoom level, objects (and applied effects) are always presented with smooth, vector edges and transitions.</p>

		<h4>Pixel (A)</h4>
		<p>During design, vector objects are presented as if they are constructed from individual pixels. This is an accurate representation of how your design will appear once exported and viewed as an image.</p>

		<h4>Retina Pixel (B)</h4>
		<p>As for Pixel mode above, but represents viewing on retina and high DPI displays.</p>

		<h4>Outline (C)</h4>
		<p>During design, page objects are presented as paths only (with no fills or strokes). All otherwise obscured paths are exposed, and selection behavior changes so grouped objects can immediately be selected just like ungrouped ones.</p>

		<h3>View</h3>

		<h4>Single View</h4>
		<p>Presents the selected mode in isolation on a single page.</p>

		<h4>Split View</h4>
		<p>Presents two modes simultaneously on the same page. A sliding divider can be repositioned to view different areas of the design in either mode.</p>
		</section>

	<section class="about">
		<h2>Clip to Canvas</h2>

		<p>This option, set by default, restricts the document view, so you can only see objects which are placed on the page. If objects extend beyond the page, the area which lies on the page is visible while the area which lies on the pasteboard is hidden. Objects which are entirely on the pasteboard are hidden.</p>
		<p>When <span class="ui">Clip to Canvas</span> is switched off, the pasteboard is visible, as are all the objects placed on it.</p>
		<p>Clip to Canvas can be used in conjunction with any of the above view options.</p>

		<h2>New View</h2>
