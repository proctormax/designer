		<h3>Settings</h3>

		<p>The following settings can be adjusted:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="ui">HSV</span>&#8212;when checked, uses the Hue Saturation Value (HSV) model instead of Hue Saturation Lightness (HSL). The Saturation Shift and Luminosity Shift sliders behave differently between the two models.</li>	
			<li><span class="ui">Color Wheel</span>&#8212;when using a particular Channel, allows you to determine the range of colors affected by that channel (e.g., <span class="ui">Greens</span>) using four nodes.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Channel</span>&#8212;represented as color nodes under the wheel. Click the first node (Master; multi-colored) to alter all colors at once or click any other node to enable a specific color set (e.g., Reds).</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Picker</span>&#8212;allows you to sample a specific color from your image on which to base your adjustment. The currently active solid color node will be updated after picking; the Master node cannot be color picked.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Hue Shift</span>&#8212;controls the color tint of pixels in the image. Drag the slider to shift the colors through the spectrum.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Saturation Shift</span>&#8212;controls the intensity of the colors in the image. Drag the slider to the left to decrease color intensity, drag to the right to increase it.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Luminosity Shift</span>&#8212;controls the overall brightness of the image. Drag the slider to the left to decrease brightness, drag to the right to increase it.</li>
		</ul>

		<aside class="box note">
			<h3>Using the <span class="ui">Channel</span> nodes</h3>
			<p>After enabling a specific color swatch under the wheel, you can adjust that color's range in different ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Drag on an individual node to reposition it around the color circle.</li>
				<li>Drag the black line that connects the colored nodes. The central line between inside nodes moves all four nodes simultaneously and in relation to each other. The black line between either outer node and its adjacent node moves just that pair of nodes independent of the other node pairing.</li>
			</ul>
		</aside>

		<aside class="box tip">
			<p>To create a desaturated (black and white) image, position the <span class="ui">Saturation Shift</span> slider to the far left with the <span class="ui">Master</span> channel selected.</p>
