	<section class="about">

		<p>A LUT (look-up table) remaps pixel color values based on a defined XYZ matrix. This allows you to quickly replicate the appearance of various types of media, such as reproducing the cold, blue tone attributed to science fiction and horror movies.</p>

		<p>The look up table is stored within a file previously exported from Affinity Photo or other applications (e.g., video packages). Alternatively, it can be inferred by comparing images.</p>

		<h3>Settings</h3>

		<p>The following settings can be adjusted in the dialog:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="ui">Load LUT</span>&#8212;sets the LUT file which gets applied to the document. In the pop-up dialog, navigate to and select a file, and click <span class="ui">Open</span>.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Infer LUT</span>&#8212; Applies a LUT adjustment without the need of a separate LUT file by comparing a 'source' image and its adjusted exported image. With a new 'target' image loaded, click <span class="ui">Infer LUT</span>, then in the pop-up dialog, navigate to and select both source and adjusted files in turn, and click <span class="ui">Open</span>.</li>
		</ul>
