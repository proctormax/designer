		<h2>Working with assets</h2>
		
		<p>Assets are created from objects or groups of objects. Once selected on the page, these objects and groups can be added to a subcategory (in the displayed category) within the <a href="../Panels/assetsPanel.html">Assets panel</a>. When a new assets category is created, this creates a subcategory for you, ready to drag objects to.</p>
		<p>An asset can be quickly added to a document by simply dragging its thumbnail from the Assets panel onto the page or an artboard.</p>

		<aside class="box note">
			<p>If a <span class="ui">Symbol</span> is added to the <span class="ui">Assets</span> panel it will not longer be associated with the Symbol in the <span class="ui">Symbols</span> panel. However, the asset will remember it's a Symbol. If it's added to a page or an artboard, it will also appear in the Symbols panel.</p>
		</aside>

		<h2>Organizing assets</h2>

		<p>Categories can be created at any time to help you organize your assets. They are then listed in the pop-up menu at the top of the Assets panel. Each category can accommodate an unlimited number of subcategories.</p>
		
		<aside class="box warning">
			<p>Assets cannot exist directly in categories, they must reside in subcategories. This is why categories are always created with a default Assets subcategory.</p>
		</aside>

		<p>Assets in the panel can be displayed as thumbnails in a grid (default) or as a named list. Tooltips display the name of an asset.</p>

		<h2>Sharing assets with collaborators</h2>

		<p>You can share assets with collaborators who are using Affinity Designer, by exporting and importing asset categories.</p>

		<aside class="box note">
			<p>The Assets panel is hidden by default. It can be switched on via <span class="ui">View&gt;Studio</span> when working in Designer or Pixel Persona.</p>
