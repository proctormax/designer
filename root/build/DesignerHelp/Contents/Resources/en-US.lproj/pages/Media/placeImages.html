		<h1>Placing content</h1>

		<p>Placing content allows you to include images and Affinity (Designer, Photo, etc.), Photoshop, Illustrator, Freehand or PDF documents into your current document without the need to open each file in turn.</p>
		
		<p>Content placed in this way can be replaced using the options on the context toolbar.</p>

		</header>

	<section class="about">
	
	<h2>About placing content</h2>
	
		<p>Once you've opened your image/document, you can place additional content.</p>
		
		<p>Some useful tips when placing content include:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>For images, the placed image is added as an image layer rather than a pixel layer. This allows the original image data (e.g., the native resolution, color space and color profile) to be kept. On export to PDF, this data is re-embedded into the PDF file.</li>
			<li>Use the context toolbar's scaling controls to ensure correct sizing of CAD-derived PDFs or PDF/PSD adverts on placement.</li>
			<li>Placed documents offer a <span class="ui">Page Box</span> option on the context toolbar to choose how the page displays (e.g., with/without bleed, objects only).</li>
			<li>The added content can be rasterized at any time via the <span class="ui">Layer</span> menu (or via right-click).</li>
			<li>The file's embedded color profile will always be converted to the document's current working space.</li>
			<li>For unprofiled placed images, the color space is assumed to be RGB.</li>
			<li>Some brush operations will automatically rasterize image layers to the document resolution.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>For further information on placing specific file types, please refer to the following table:</p>
		
		<table class="thirtythree">
			<tr>
				<th>Content type</th>
				<th>Comments</th>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>Affinity Designer files with multiple artboards</td>
				<td>You'll be provided with an <span class="ui">Artboard</span> option on the document's context toolbar so you can choose which artboard is displayed.</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>Affinity documents, PDFs and PSD files</td>
				<td>The file will be listed in the Layers panel as either an 'Embedded document' or 'Linked document' depending on the <span class="ui">Image Placement Policy</span> set during initial Document Setup.</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>SVG, PSD and EPS files</td>
				<td>These will be converted to embedded Affinity Documents on placement and the original data is not retained; you can't write the embedded file out to its native file format and make it linked.</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>Multi-page Affinity documents or PDFs</td>
				<td>You can choose which page or spread you want to display by using <span class="ui">Spread</span> on the context toolbar. For PDF, only one page can ever be displayed, although you can simulate a spread by duplicating the placed object and choosing a different page to view.</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>Placed PDFs</td>
				<td>These offer a <span class="ui">PDF Passthrough</span> option on the context toolbar, which defaults to Passthrough for exact reproduction within your own PDFs. If that's not possible, the Interpret option is selected. A bitmap preview of the PDFâ€™s contents is displayed while editing your document in Affinity Designer.</td>
			</tr>

		</table>
		
		<p>Once added to your page, you have the option to replace the content, retaining its position, as well as edit placed content.</p>
