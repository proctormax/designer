		<h1>Resource Manager</h1>
	
		<p>The Resource Manager lists all of the image and document resources used in your document.</p>
		
	</header>
		
	<section class="about">
		
		<p>From the Resource Manager, you can view the status of all resources, the placement of the resource (linked or embedded), the file size, placed DPI, and file type. If the same resource is used multiple times within the document, they will be grouped together in the list.</p>
		<p>Right-clicking on any of the column headers allows you check or uncheck columns to display or hide them.</p>
		<p>The key difference between linked files and embedded files is the location of the stored data and if data is updated after being linked or embedded. Embedded files are stored in the document and can't be subsequently updated if the source file changes, i.e. there is no link to the source file. Linked files are not stored in the document and can therefore be updated (via Resource Manager) in the document from the source file if the source file changes.</p>
	 	<p>A placed image or document can have the following Status:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="ui">OK</span>&#8212;The file is up to date.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Modified</span>&#8212;The linked file has been modified externally. Click <span class="ui">Update</span> to get the latest version.</li>
 				<li><span class="ui">Missing</span>&#8212; Although still placed and displayed, the linked file has been deleted or moved externally to the app.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Additionally, you can use the Resource Manager's <span class="ui">Collect</span> feature to prepare a project with linked resources for sharing. This lets you gather together distributed linked resources into a single folder, typically a subfolder under the main document. You can then zip up the document and subfolder together and hand over to another colleague or partner.</p>

		<aside class="box tip">
			<p>Use <span class="ui">Save As</span> if you want to collect resources to a new document which can be shared. You can continue to use the original document with uncollected resources.</p>
