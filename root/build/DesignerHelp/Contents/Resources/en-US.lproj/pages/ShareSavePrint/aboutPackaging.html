		<h1>About packaging</h1>
		<p>Packaging is an easy way to ensure that when you share a document with a collaborator or printing service, they have all the items needed to edit and print it.</p>
		<p>The <span class="ui">Save as Package</span> command outputs a copy of your document and any fonts and linked images used by it into a folder. Your chosen folder must be empty beforehand.<p>
	</header>
	
	<section class="about">
		<h2 id="packageContents">A package's contents</h2>
		<p>When packaging is complete, the destination folder will contain:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your Affinity Designer document, with the file extension .afpackage.</li>
			<li>A folder named Fonts containing available fonts used by your document.</li>
			<li>A folder named Images containing available images linked from your document.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The items in the package are copies. The files used to create the package remain in their original locations and are unaltered by the packaging process.</p>
		<p>With everything collated in a folder, share the package with others using your preferred method, such as cloud storage. Before doing so, review your licensing terms for all items in the package.</p>
		
		<h2>Differences between Save as Package and Collect</h2>
		<p>The Resource Manager's <span class="ui">Collect</span> feature may sound similar to Save as Package. However, it is designed to collate some or all of a document's linked resources in a folder and update the references to their new location. Also, it does not process fonts.</p>
