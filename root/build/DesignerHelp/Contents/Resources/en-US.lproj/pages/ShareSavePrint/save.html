		<p>The first time you save your document, you'll be asked to give the project a name and save location. Following this, future saves will overwrite the previous version.</p>
		<p>Optionally, you can save a current project as a new project. In this case, the new file will not overwrite the saved version.</p>
		<p class="win32">Unsaved changes to a document are indicated by <span class="ui">[Modified]</span> to the right of the document's name at the top of its tab/window.</p>
