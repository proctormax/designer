		<h2>Dealing with font issues</h2>
		<p>When opening a package, the dialog's <span class="ui">Fonts</span> section displays additional columns.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="ui">Package</span>&#8212;indicates whether a corresponding font file is included in the package. If included, it may be listed as <a href="../ShareSavePrint/creatingPackages.html#dialogStatuses">Restricted</a>.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Install</span>&#8212;when ticked, Affinity Designer will temporarily load the included font file for its exclusive and temporary use.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Discuss font licensing with the package's provider/recipient accordingly.</p>

		<aside class="box tip">
			<p>A prominent yellow warning sign is displayed next to any font that is restricted or not included in the package.</p>
		</aside>
		
		<h2>Installing fonts</h2>
		<p>Fonts listed as Missing in the <span class="ui">Status</span> column are not installed on the current device.</p>
		<p>If such a font is included in the package, tick the checkbox in its <span class="ui">Install</span> column to make it available only to Affinity Designer and only for the current session. This enables the recipient to export and print the document as is.</p>
		<p>If the document needs to be edited and fonts not installed on the current device are included in the package's Fonts folder, use your operating system's built-in mechanism or a third-party tool to install the fonts.</p>
		
		<aside class="box warning">
			<p>Even if font files are provided in a package, it is your responsibility to investigate and adhere to their licensing terms before installing them on your device.</p>
		</aside>
		
		<h2>Dealing with image issues</h2>
		<p>Consult the package's provider if an image is reported as Missing. They may have removed it from the package due to licensing restrictions that prevent it being shared.</p>
		
		<p>You will not need to locate images listed as Present. When packaging, Affinity Designer updates a document's links to these resources to use the files in the package's Images folder.</p>
				
		<h2>Editing a packaged document</h2>
		<p>Changes cannot be saved to the <a href="../ShareSavePrint/aboutPackaging.html#packageContents">.afpackage file</a>. This preserves its state in case it is needed again.</p>
		<p>To save changes, use <span class="ui">File&gt;Save As</span> to create a new .afdesign file from the package.</p>
