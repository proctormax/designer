		<h1>Using adjustment layers</h1>

		<p>Use adjustment layers to apply an adjustment to your vector/pixel layer (or object). This is carried out non-destructively (i.e., without permanently affecting the original layer or object).</p>

		<h2>About adjustment layers</h2>
		<p>The <span class="ui">Layers</span> panel provides a range of adjustments directly from the panel. When an item is selected, the adjustment layer is applied to just that item, i.e. it is <a href="layerClip.html">clipped</a>. With no selection in place, the adjustment is applied to the entire spread.</p>
		<p>Adjustment layers also have mask layer properties. Areas of an adjustment layer can be revealed or hidden in the same way as with a mask layer.</p>

		<aside class="box note">
			<p>If you have a <a href="../Selections/selections_create.html">pixel selection</a> in place when you add an adjustment layer, the area selected is automatically masked. If you have a vector object selected, then the adjustment layer is created as a child of the object layer. This behavior can be changed in the Assistant Manager options.</p>

		<aside class="box note">
			<p>Adjustment layers can have a unique <a href="../Layers/layerBlendModes.html">blend mode</a> assigned.</p>

						<li>Select an object, group or image to add the adjustment to the item, affecting just that item only.</li>
						<li>Deselect all items to add the adjustment at the top of the layer stack, applying the adjustment to all items below it (the entire spread).</li>

				<li>Drag the adjustment above or below objects within a layer to affect more or fewer objects on the layer.</li>
				<li>Drag the adjustment onto an object to make it a child of that object and confine the affect of the adjustment to that object only.</li>
