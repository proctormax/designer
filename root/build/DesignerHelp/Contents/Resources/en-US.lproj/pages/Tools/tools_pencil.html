		<p>With the <span class="ui">Pencil Tool</span> you can create a hand-drawn look by drawing freehand, variable width, lines as if you were drawing on paper.</p>

		<p>As you draw, nodes are created automatically along the stroke which can optionally be smoothed as you draw by enabling the <span class="ui">Stabiliser</span> feature. A <span class="ui">Sculpt</span> mode also lets you reform or continue your pencil stroke at any time, although you can use the <span class="ui">Node Tool</span> to edit too. When using a combination of sculpting and Use Fill, you can form conjoined pencil strokes that can take a fill with the stroke's concave area.</p>

		<p>Its variable width lines can be controlled either by velocity&#8212;most useful when drawing with a mouse&#8212;or by pressure&#8212;for use when drawing with a pressure sensitive pen tablet.</p>

		<h2>Adjusting the tool's appearance</h2>
		
		<p>Line styles are applied using the <span class="ui">Stroke</span> panel. For brush textures, pick a brush from the <span class="ui">Brushes</span> panel.</p>

		<h3>Settings</h3>
		
		<p>The following settings can be adjusted from the context toolbar:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="ui">Stroke</span>&#8212;the color of your stroke. Click the color swatch to select from solid colors, a picked color, color gradients or from your preset or custom color swatches.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Width</span>&#8212;the line thickness in points. Type directly in the text box or drag the pop-up slider to set the value.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Sculpt</span>&#8212;when enabled, any selected pencil stroke can be reshaped or continued; the former by drawing new start and end stops anywhere along the pencil stroke, the latter by drawing from either stroke end node.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Controller</span>&#8212;controls whether the tool is sensitive to real pressure ('Pressure') or speed of mouse movement ('Velocity' or 'Inverse Velocity'). Select 'None' to use neither.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Stabilizer</span>&#8212;enables stroke stabilization using either a <span class="ui">Rope stabilizer</span> or <span class="ui">Window stabilizer</span> mode; the former drags the stroke end by a 'rope' to smooth the stroke but lets you introduce sharp corners at increasing rope <span class="ui">Length</span> (radius) values by redirecting the slackened rope; the latter will smooth the stroke by averaging sampled input positions within a <span class="ui">Window</span> whose size is configurable.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Use Fill</span>&#8212;when checked, the concave area of the stroke is filled with the currently set fill color (from <span class="ui">Color</span> panel) as you draw. In Sculpt mode, continuing strokes remains as one object, which allows the fill to be applied along the stroke's length.</li>
