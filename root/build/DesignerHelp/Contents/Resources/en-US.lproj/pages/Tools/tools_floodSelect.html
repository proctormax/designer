		<p>The <span class="ui">Flood Select Tool</span> enables you to select pixels of a similar color.</p>

	</header>

	<section class="about">
	
		<p>Pixels added to a selection are determined by the color of the pixel or adjacent pixels under the tool when you click or drag across the page, respectively. The dragging operation controls the selection tolerance, i.e. how much the selection will grow to encompass pixels of similar color values under the cursor.</p>

	<section class="settings">
		<h3>Settings</h3>

		<p>The following settings can be adjusted from the context toolbar:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="ui">Mode</span>&#8212;select from <span class="ui">New</span>, <span class="ui">Add</span>, <span class="ui">Subtract</span>, and <span class="ui">Intersect</span>.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Source</span>&#8212;the source determines the layer(s) from which the pixels are sampled. Select from the pop-up menu.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Tolerance</span>&#8212;sets the range of pixels affected when a pixel is clicked. For lower tolerance settings, pixels must be very close in value to the clicked pixel. For higher tolerance settings, pixel color can vary widely from the clicked pixel.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Contiguous</span>&#8212;when enabled, only selects a range of pixels within the same area. If disabled, similar pixel ranges will be selected even if they are separated and in different parts of the image.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Refine</span>&#8212;click to display the <a href="../Selections/selections_refine.html">Refine Selection</a> dialog to access advanced selection settings.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>About selection modes</h3>

		<p>The four modes available from the context toolbar affect how your selection develops.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><span class="ui">New</span>&#8212;cancels all current selections and creates a new selection.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Add</span>&#8212;adds areas to the current selection. If there is no selection in place, a new selection will be created.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Subtract</span>&#8212;removes areas from the current selection.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Intersect</span>&#8212;a new selection area is created from the overlap between the newly added selection area and the current selection.</li>
		</ul>
