		<h1>Using Surface Dial</h1>
		<p>Microsoft's Surface Dial enables you to invoke Affinity menu commands and adjust tool settings by clicking and turning a rotary control.</p>
		<p>To use it with your Affinity app, first follow <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023515">Microsoft's instructions</a> to connect it to your PC, then enable support in your Affinity app's preferences: select <span class="ui">Tools</span> and tick <span class="ui">Enable Dial support</span>.</p>
	</header>
	
	<section class="about">
		<h2>Integration with your Affinity app</h2>
		<p>After restarting the app, turning the dial while the <span class="ui">Move Tool</span> is selected will rotate the document in the view. Click the dial to reset the document's orientation.</p>
		<p>With one of the Pixel, Erase or various other pixel-based brush tools selected, click Surface Dial to choose which attribute (brush width, accumulation, flow, and hardness) is adjusted by rotating the Dial. These tools display a large graphical overlay that provides clear feedback.</p>

			<figcaption>Examples of on-screen displays when controlling brush attributes (left) and selecting custom commands (right).</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>If a tool does not provide predefined Surface Dial gestures, you can assign choices in Windows' Settings app. Your custom commands are available from an on-screen menu, which appears when you press and hold down on the Dial.</p>

		<aside class="box note">
			<p>Some commands in your Affinity app do not have keyboard shortcuts assigned to them by default. You will need to give them shortcuts in the app's Keyboard Shortcuts preferences before configuring Surface Dial to invoke them.</p>
		</aside>
		
		<h2>Example custom commands for Surface Dial in Affinity apps</h2>
		<p>Below are examples of how you might use Surface Dial in your workflow to control brush size and layer order. The walkthroughs at the bottom of this page explain how to implement these and other personalizations.</p>

		</figure>

		<p>In the left example above, rotating the Dial moves the current layer back or forward progressively in the layer stack, while clicking it sends the layer all the way to the back.</p>
		<p>In the right example, rotating the Dial adjusts brush size (as long as the appropriate tool is selected). The <span class="ui">Click shortcut</span> toggles the Brushes Panel; normally there is no keyboard shortcut assigned to this action, so you'll need to set the same key combination in your Affinity app's preferences.</p>
