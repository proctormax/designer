		<h1>Hardware acceleration</h1>
		<p class="osx">To improve the performance of some operations, Affinity Designer can use Apple's Metal technology to talk directly to your system's graphics hardware.</p>
		<p class="win32">To improve the performance of some operations, Affinity Designer can use OpenCL technology to talk directly to your system's graphics hardware.</p>
		<p>Hardware acceleration is available for many graphics processors (GPUs), whether integrated into your computer's CPU (central processing unit), a discrete graphics card or onboard processor, or external and connected via Thunderbolt 3. Affinity Designer can make use of multiple GPUs in parallel.</p>
		<p>It is recommended that hardware acceleration is enabled unless you experience unusual performance problems or our technical support team instructs you to disable it.</p>
		
		<aside class="box note">
			<p>Hardware acceleration is enabled by default. If you experience poorer performance than expected, try disabling it to see if CPU-based processing works better on your system.</p>

		<h2>Benefits</h2>
		<p>In practice, the performance boost depends on the task at hand.</p>
		<p>Hardware acceleration is of great benefit to many raster-based tasks. Vector operations and specific features like blend ranges are performed on the CPU.</p>
		<p>Tools, adjustments, canvas previewing and other operations will use GPU resources to achieve improved performance.</p>		
		
		<h2>Cost</h2>
		<p>As a trade-off, memory requirements are increased and performance may be dependent on the amount of VRAM available to the GPU(s).</p>
		<p>The VRAM requirement depends on the complexity of your workflow. Document resolution and bit depth, screen resolution, and layer complexity all contribute to it.</p>
	
		<h2>System requirements</h2>
		<p class="osx">Affinity support for Metal compute acceleration requires macOS High Sierra 10.13 or later.</p>
		<p class="osx">Affinity support for safe unplugging of eGPUs requires macOS Mojave 10.14 or later.</p>
		<p class="win32">Affinity support for OpenCL compute acceleration requires Windows 10.0.19042 (May 2020) or later.</p>
		<p class="win32">It also requires GPU support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_levels_in_Direct3D#Direct3D_12" target="_blank">Direct3D 12 Feature Level 12.0</a>, meaning the GPU must feature AMD's GCN (Graphics Core Next), NVIDIA's Maxwell, or Intel HD Graphics 510 (Skylake) or a later microarchitecture.</p>
