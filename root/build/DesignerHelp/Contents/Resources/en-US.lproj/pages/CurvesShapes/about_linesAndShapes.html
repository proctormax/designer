		<h1>About lines, curves and shapes</h1>

		<p>When you want to draw vector shapes and curves you'll need to use the <a href="../Tools/tools_pen.html">Pen</a>, <a href="../Tools/tools_pencil.html">Pencil</a>, <a href="../Tools/tools_Brush.html">Vector Brush</a> and <a href="draw_geometricShapes.html">Shape</a> tools. Editing curves and shapes is done with the <a href="../Tools/tools_node.html">Node</a> tool or the <span class="key CMD-TAG"></span> <span class="KEY-TAG"></span> as you draw.</p>

		<aside class="box note">
			<p>Curves and shapes have both stroke and fill properties. These can be defined before creation and can be modified at any point afterwards.</p>

	<section class="about">
		<h2>Curves and lines</h2>

		<p>A curve is an <span class="term">open</span> path that has a distinct start and end. These end stops are defined by <span class="term">nodes</span>. A curve with just two nodes is referred to as a <span class="term">line</span>.</p>
		<p>The path between nodes is known as a <span class="term">segment</span> and can be straight (A) or arched (B). Complex curves are created from multiple nodes connected by segments (C). Lines and curves generally have a stroke applied.</p>

		<p><img src="../../../shared/path_straightOrCurved.png" class="screenshot responsive" alt="Segment types" /></p>

		<p>The type of node controls the connected segments. There are three basic types of node:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Sharp (A)&#8212;causes an abrupt change in direction between segments, creating a point.</li>
			<li>Bézier (smooth) (B)&#8212;creates a continuous curve between segments.</li>
			<li>Smart (C)&#8212;creates a continuous curve but uses a line of best fit.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><img src="../../../shared/path_nodeTypes.png" class="screenshot responsive" alt="Node types" /></p>

		<p>When drawing curves, any combination of nodes can be used. Each node also has <span class="term">control handles</span>. These appear when the node is selected. The length and slope of the control handles determine the shape of the segment. A node can be edited at any time.</p>

		<p>There are advantages to being able to add multiple curves&#8212;for example, if you want to make use of odd-even winding for filling with multiple curves.</p>

			</ul>			
		</aside>

		<h2>Shapes</h2>

		<p>A shape is a <span class="term">closed</span> path with no discernible start or end. It is made up of multiple nodes and segments.</p>

		<p><img src="../../../shared/path_closing.png" class="screenshot responsive" alt="Close path" /></p>

		<p>You can also easily create geometric shapes using the <a href="draw_geometricShapes.html">Shape</a> tools. These have special properties that enable you to quickly create otherwise difficult to draw shapes, such as circles, rectangles and polygons.</p>
