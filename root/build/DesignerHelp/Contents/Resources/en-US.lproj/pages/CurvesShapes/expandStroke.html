		<p>Drawing a line creates an open path with a skeletal structure that can be adjusted. The boundaries of a line, on the other hand cannot be edited. Expanding the stroke converts the line's boundaries into paths forming a closed shape, so you can edit them individually in the same way as a regular shape.</p>

		<p>The expand stroke feature has a range of uses. It can be used to:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Modify the shape of strokes by adjusting its curves and nodes.</li>
			<li>Separate a shape into its two components: its stroke and fill (without stroke outline)</li>
			<li>Convert strokes to flattened shapes that can scale better as a flattened image, which looks more consistent across browsers.</li>
			<li>Flatten strokes prior to SVG export in web development.</li>
		</ul>

			<ol>
				<li>Select the shape with either the <span class="ui">Move Tool</span> or the <span class="ui">Node Tool</span>.</li>
				<li>Click <span class="ui">Expand Stroke</span> on the <span class="ui">Layer</span> menu.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The shape's stroke is now detached from the object and made into curves. As with <span class="ui">Convert to Curves</span>, the resulting curves can then be manipulated with the <span class="ui">Node Tool</span>.</p>
			
			<aside class="box tip">
				<p>Pixel brush strokes, either as standalone strokes or on object outlines, cannot be expanded as they are based on pixels rather than being vector.</p>
