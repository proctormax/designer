		<h1>Assets panel</h1>

		<p>The <span class="ui">Assets</span> panel acts as an area for storing design elements which you can then access from any Affinity Designer document. By default, the panel is populated with UI design elements for developing iOS-based designs.</p>
		
	</header>

	<section class="about">

		<p>The <span class="ui">Assets</span> panel is hidden by default. It can be switched on via <span class="ui">View&gt;Studio</span> when working in Designer or Pixel Persona.</p>

		<aside class="box tip">
			<p>Assets are listed in the Assets panel in the order in which they were added. However, you can manually reorder assets in the panel by dragging them while holding down the <span class="key ALT-TAG"></span> <span class="KEY-TAG"></span>.</p>

		</ul>

		<p><img src="../../../shared/ui/moremenuicon.png" class="tool" width="15" height="11" alt="Panel Preferences" /> The following options are available from panel preferences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="ui">Create New Category</span>&#8212;adds a new, custom assets category to the panel.</li>

			<li><span class="ui">Sort Categories By</span>&#8212;allows you to sort assets categories by <span class="ui">Name</span> or <span class="ui">Date Added</span>.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Create Subcategory</span>&#8212;adds a new subcategory to the currently selected category.</li>
			<li><span class="ui"><a href="../Appendix/importingAssets.html">Import Assets</a></span>&#8212;allows you to add an .afassets file and adds a new category to the panel pre-populated with subcategories and assets from your imported file.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Export Assets</span>&#8212;creates an *.afassets file containing the assets and subcategory structure from the currently selected category.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Embed in current document</span>&#8212;embeds the assets in your Assets panel into your current document so that they can be accessed when opening the document later on a different computer (or on the same computer if assets were deleted).

			<li><span class="ui">Show As List</span>&#8212;if this option is off (default), assets are displayed as thumbnails in a grid with tooltips displaying their name. When selected, assets are displayed as named thumbnails in a list.</li>

			<li><span class="ui">Move Down</span>&#8212;repositions the subcategory below the next subcategory so it is listed lower in the panel. If this option is grayed out, the subcategory is at the bottom of the panel.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Add from Selection</span>&#8212;adds all the objects in the current on-page selection to the subcategory as assets. Grouped objects are added as a single asset.</li>
