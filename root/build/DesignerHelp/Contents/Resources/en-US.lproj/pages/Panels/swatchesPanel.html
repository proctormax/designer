		<h2>About the Swatches panel</h2>

		<x-osx><p>The <span class="ui">Swatches</span> panel stores your recently used colors and lets you access a range of predefined palettes, each containing solid or gradient fill swatches. These can be selected for use with various tools and for applying directly to objects. You can also create and store your own swatches as custom color palettes either for the document, application or system-wide, as well as import any exported Affinity .afpalette from other users or import Adobe Swatch Exchange (ASE) palettes.</p></x-osx>

		<p>As well as accessing palette, you can create global and spot colors, and make colors overprint. Your registration color can also be customized.</p>

		<p>Like the <span class="ui">Color</span> panel, the Swatches panel has different states depending on the active Persona and on the selected tool. The large color swatch selectors indicate the currently selected colors.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>In Designer Persona, objects have fill and stroke color properties. The stroke color is represented by the cutout (donut) color selector. The fill is represented by the solid color selector.</li>
			<li>In Pixel Persona, the two solid color selectors indicate interchangeable Primary and Secondary colors.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The <span class="ui">Swatches</span> panel also shows None, Black, Mid-gray and White swatches, recently used colors and an opacity control. Swatches are organized into color palettes by category.</p>

		<aside class="box note">
			<p><img src="../../../shared/ui/moremenuicon.png" class="tool" width="15" height="11" alt="Panel Preferences" /> To add a customized registration color for professional printing, click <span class="ui">Panel Preferences</span>, then select <span class="ui">Add Registration Color</span>.</p>

		<h2>Working with palettes</h2>

		<p>The ten most recently used colors are automatically added to the panel on a temporary basis. You can permanently store custom colors and gradients that you use most often in any of the palettes or you can create custom palettes to host them.</p>

		<aside class="box tip">
			<p>Although you can add colors to any of the predefined palette categories, we recommend that you always create your own.</p>
		</aside>

		<p>The following types of palette exist within Affinity Designer:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><span class="ui">Document</span>&#8212;these palettes are saved within the current document.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Application</span>&#8212;these palettes are saved within Affinity Designer. These palettes are available to any Affinity Designer document.</li>
			<li class="osx"><span class="ui">System</span>&#8212;these palettes are saved to your operating system. These palettes are available within Affinity Designer and other applications installed on your system.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">PANTONE®</span>&#8212;these palettes are based on PANTONE® Colors. These palettes are available to any Affinity Designer document.</li>
