			<ul>
				<li><span class="ui">Kerning</span>&#8212;controls the kerning (distance) between characters. <span class="ui">Auto</span> will automatically kern characters by default. Positive values give expanded kerning, negative values give condensed kerning. This setting is expressed in permilles, i.e. thousandths of an em space.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Tracking</span>&#8212;controls the spacing between characters. This setting is expressed in permilles, i.e. thousandths of an em space.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Baseline</span>&#8212;controls where characters naturally sit on a line. Increasing the value lowers the baseline, decreasing the value raises the baseline.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Leading Override</span>&#8212;applies local override to selected text to increase the leading with regard to the paragraphâ€™s leading.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Shear</span>&#8212;controls the extent of text slant. Positive values will tilt text to the right, negative values will tilt text to the left.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Horizontal Scale</span>&#8212;stretches the characters and spacing width with regard to point size.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Vertical Scale</span>&#8212;stretches the characters with regard to point size.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Superscript</span>&#8212;converts text characters to superscript, i.e. characters are set higher than neighboring characters and font size is decreased.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Subscript</span>&#8212;converts text characters to subscript, i.e. characters are set lower than neighboring characters and font size is decreased.</li>

			<summary>Optical Alignment</summary>
			<p>Optical Alignment determines how certain characters in your document (for example, punctuation marks or particular letters) will fit in relation to the text frame; this can be used to automatically extend lines beginning or ending with certain characters when text frames are snapped to page margin. Adjust the settings to ensure the characters you choose are aligned to your liking.</p>
