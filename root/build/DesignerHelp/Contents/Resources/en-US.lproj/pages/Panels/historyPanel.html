		<h1>History panel</h1>

		<p>The <span class="ui">History</span> panel tracks changes and shows each state as a labeled entry in a list. This allows you to return to earlier points in time quickly and easily.</p>

	<h2>About the History panel</h2>

		<p>The <span class="ui">History</span> panel shows changes that are applied. The oldest state is the topmost in the list. When edits are made, new states are added to the bottom of the list.</p>

		<aside class="box tip">
			<p>A document's <a href="../DesignAids/undo.html">history can be saved</a> along with the document, so earlier edits can be returned to even if the document is closed and reopened.</p>
		</aside>

		<figure class="nft overrideDE overrideFR">
			<p><img src="../../images/panel_history.png" class="responsive panel" alt="history panel" /></p>
			<figcaption>The History panel showing the actions that have been carried out on the file.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>If you click on an earlier state and then make a change, the new timeline you have created will be listed in the place of the original set of changes you made beyond that point. You can cycle between timelines by clicking on the Cycle future icon.</p>

		<aside class="box note">
			<p>Unless you choose to save the document's history with the document, the undo states listed in the <span class="ui">History</span> panel are cleared when the document is closed.</p>
		</aside>

	<section class="settings">
		<h3>Options</h3>

		<p>The following options are available in the panel:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><span class="ui">Position</span>&#8212;points on the slider represent edits made to a document from root (creation or opening) on the left to the latest edit on the right. Drag the slider left to undo a change, right to redo a change.</li>
			<li>State&#8212;gives a brief description of the edit made to the document. Click a state to jump back/forward to that edit.</li>
			<li><img src="../../../shared/ui/cycle_futures.png" class="tool" width="18" height="18" alt="Cycle Future" /> <span class="ui">Cycle future</span>&#8212;appears where the history was changed, storing all of the original edits associated with that 'branch' of the timeline. If you want to revert to an old redo history after making a change, click the <span class="ui">Cycle future</span> icon beside the point in the timeline you wish to revert to in order to go back to your preferred redo history. You can click this again to toggle between the different series of edits you made beyond this point.</li>
