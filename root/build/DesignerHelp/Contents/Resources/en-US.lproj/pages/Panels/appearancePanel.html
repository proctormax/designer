 		<p>From the <span class="ui">Appearance</span> panel you can:</p>
 			<ul>
 				<li>Manage strokes and fills for the selected object</li>
 				<li>Apply additional strokes and fills to the selected object</li>
 				<li>Hide or show strokes and fills</li>
 				<li>Set the active stroke and fill which can then be edited via the <span class="ui">Stroke</span> and <span class="ui">Color</span> panels</li>
 				<li>Apply independent blending control of strokes or fills instead of for the object</li>
 				<li>Delete strokes and fills</li>
 			</ul>
 	
		<p>The panel displays the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><span class="ui">Stroke</span>&#8212;the stroke entry showing the stroke color, width and blend mode. The active stroke will be denoted by a white dot to the left of its entry. This is the stroke that will be affected by <span class="ui">Stroke</span> panel editing.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Fill</span>&#8212;the fill entry showing the fill color and blend mode. The active fill will be denoted by a white dot to the left of its entry. This is the fill that will be affected by <span class="ui">Color</span> panel editing.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Add Stroke</span>&#8212;creates a new active stroke above the current active stroke.</li>
			<li><span class="ui">Add Fill</span>&#8212;creates a new active fill above the current active fill.</li>
